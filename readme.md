# LazyLabel
LazyLabel lets you label data using your voice. 

At the moment I'm just aiming to have really basic functionality to assist with my Pokemon Classification project. 
Thus, this programme should have a GUI that allows you to choose a folder, then shows you each image in the folder, 
to which voice recognition is used to keep or delete data and move to the next image. 

## Future functionality
Would be cool to have different key words
Assign key presses to label (would be good for side mouse buttons)
Better labelling than just keep and delete (which isn't even labelling)
